// Model-memory (residency) rows — the SINGLE source of truth for which modalities are
// listed, their copy, and the accessible names of their switches.
//
// This is deliberately a pure, import-free module: the renderer builds the UI from it and
// the E2E suite imports it to derive the selectors it queries. Before this existed the
// switch labels were an inline template in the markup and the E2E spec re-hardcoded them —
// they drifted ("Chat model residency" vs the real "Chat and capture model residency",
// "Dictation (speech-to-text) residency" vs "Dictation residency") and the spec silently
// stopped matching anything. Deriving both sides from here makes a rename fail a test
// instead of orphaning one.
